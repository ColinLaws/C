# C Programming Language Practice
This repository contains many projects which I am completing as I
read the book "The C Programming Language: Second Edition". 

I wanted to begin uploading my progress to show that I am actively
learning C by the book at the moment, and I hope this will motivate
me to continue on in learning systems programming.

## Building
So far, most examples can be compiled by simply running:
`cc main.c -o program-name`, as I have not yet moved on to multi-file
projects or projects which use Make or CMake. I will be sure to update
build instructions and provide them per project when necessary.

## Grading and Feedback
If you would like to contribute feedback while I learn, I would greatly
appreciate any comments on my code. Thanks for taking a look.
